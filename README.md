# Database-Design-and-ETL-in-MySQL
In this project we will design a MySQL database, populate it with the data we got through scraping some websites using Selenium and generating fake data using Faker. Run some EDA using SQL then build a dashboard.

The project : ETL and database design.
What did we do :
•	Scrape data from different websites using Selenium.
•	Generate fake data using Python’s library Faker.
•	Transform our data to the desired format.
•	Using MySQL-Python Connector, we connected to our MySQL Workbench and designed our database.
•	Load our data into the database we built.
•	EDA and some cleaning using SQL.
•	Run a query to get relevant data and save in a xlsx file so we can connect to Tableau and build a dashboard. (Note: Using Tableau Desktop you can connect directly to the database. But since I use the community/public version, I can only connect to csv/xlsx files).
